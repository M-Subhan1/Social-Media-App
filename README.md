# Social-Media-App
This Social Media Website allows users to create an account, log in, and start sharing posts with their followers. Other users can like and comment on these posts, and users can also follow and unfollow each other to receive updates in their activity feed.

The website is built using Node.js and Express for the server-side, MongoDB for the database, and Handlebars for the view templates. This allows for a fast and efficient way to handle user requests and render dynamic web pages.

The website also includes user authentication and registration to ensure that only registered users can access the full range of features. This is implemented using password hashing and session management to keep user data secure.

With its simple and intuitive interface, this Social Media Website provides a powerful platform for users to connect and share with each other.
